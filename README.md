Remake of the Ruby/Sapphire Pokemon battle interface.

With all the hype from Pokemon Red/Blue 20th anniversary and as a small HTML/CSS positioning exercise, I attempted to remake the battle interface from my most played pokemon game, Sapphire.

Image used as a reference for positioning:

All the HTML & CSS was aimed at keeping the interface as responsive as possible.
