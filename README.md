Remake of the Ruby/Sapphire Pokemon battle interface.

With all the hype from Pokemon Red/Blue 20th anniversary, I've decided to attempt to remake the battle interface from my most played pokemon game: Sapphire.

All the HTML & CSS was aimed at keeping the interface as responsive as possible, however responsive design isn't my strong point. 

Feedback is appreciated! :)
